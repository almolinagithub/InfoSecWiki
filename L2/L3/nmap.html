       <h3>Scan Network Range</h3>
            <p>sudo nmap [networkaddress]/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5</p>
            <p> if an IP list has to be scanned include the ".lst" file with the IPs and use the "-iL" switch</p>
            <p>Used Scanning Options : -sn	-oA tnet	-iL hosts.lst</p>
            <p>Only works id the hosts can reply to ICMP</p>
            <p></p>
        <h3>Scan multiple addresses</h3>
        <p>sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet [ip][ip][ip]| grep for | cut -d" " -f5</p>
        <p>Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "--reason" option.</p>
        <p>sudo nmap [ip] -sn -oA host -PE --reason </p>
        <p>Nmap does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the ARP request and ARP reply alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired ICMP echo requests, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "--disable-arp-ping" option.</p>
        <p>sudo nmap [ip] -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping </p>

    <table>
        <th align="left">State</th><th align="left">Description</th>
        <tr><td>open</td><td>This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>closed</td><td>	When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>filtered</td><td>Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>unfiltered</td><td>This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>open|filtered</td><td>If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
            /td></tr>
        <tr><td>closed|filtered</td><td>This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.
        </td></tr>

    <p>
        By default, Nmap scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (-sS). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (-sT) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. </p>
    <p>
        We can define the ports one by one (-p 22,25,80,139,445), by range (-p 22-445), by top ports (--top-ports=10) from the Nmap database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (-p-) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (-F).
